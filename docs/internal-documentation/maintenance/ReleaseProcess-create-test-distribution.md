Release process - Create Test Distribution
==========================================

The purpose of this part is to create the test distributions that can be
used in QA testing for a release. It can also be used to create test
distributions to verify a pull request.


## 1. Prepare a build environment
Set up build system to be used for the test distribution creation. See
[Build Environment Preparation] for set it up.


## 2. Create a clean environment

Make sure that you have checked out the correct git branch, normally
the `develop` branch and that your clone is up-to-date.

       git fetch --all
       git branch

Make sure your working directory is clean.

       git status --ignored

> **Note:** To throw away any and all changes to tracked and untracked files you
> can run `git clean -dfx ; git reset --hard`.

To clean:

       git clean -dfx
       git reset --hard

You should usually work in the *develop branch*, and that should be up-to-date
with the remote *develop branch*. Your working branch:

    git branch -av | grep "^*"

All branches called "develop":

    git branch -av --list "*develop"


## 3. Generate Makefile, META.yml and others

> This section is not relevant for Zonemaster-GUI.

 * For Zonemaster-LDNS:

       perl Makefile.PL --no-ed25519

 * For all components except Zonemaster-LDNS:

       perl Makefile.PL

> **Note: You can ignore the following warnings:**
> * Missing META.yml (created by the very same command).
> * Zonemaster-LDNS: Missing ldns source files (fetched by the very same command).
> * Zonemaster-Engine and Zonemaster-CLI: Missing .mo files (created in a later step).
> * Missing prerequisite (only needed on target system), e.g.:
>   * "Warning: prerequisite JSON::XS 0 not found."

## 4. Verify that MANIFEST is up to date and that tarball can be built

> This section is not relevant for Zonemaster-GUI.

Build generated files (if any) and verify that a distribution tarball can be 
successfully built for each component that is to be updated in this release.

    make all

For all components, make sure that all files are covered by MANIFEST and/or 
MANIFEST.SKIP, i.e. no missing or extra files:

    make distcheck


## 5. Produce distribution tarballs

> This section is not relevant for Zonemaster-GUI.

    make dist



## 5. Produce distribution zip file

> This section is relevant for Zonemaster-GUI only.

The requirements are nodejs and npm. There are available from the [Node.js]
official website. Minimal version of Nodejs is 10.0 but install the last LTS
version available. It was tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

To build a new development environnement, you need to install nodejs.
We use [NVM], a node version manager.

1. `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`
2. `nvm install 13.12.0`
3. `nvm use 13.12.0`

To build the tarballs, steps are: 

1. `git clone https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-gui.git`
2. `cd zonemaster-gui`
3. `npm install` 
4. `npm run release`

The distribution zip file is in the root level of the zonemaster-gui folder. 
Its name is `zonemaster_web_gui.zip`.


## 6. Verify that Zonemaster works when installed

Verify that Zonemaster works when installed according to the documented
installation procedures

Using the *preliminary distribution tarballs* produced in step 4 above
and the *preliminary distribution zip file* produced in step 5 above,
follow the procedures in [SystemTesting].

If the system testing fails in a way that requires updated distribution
tarballs (zip file):
 1. Get the changes merged.
 2. Consider whether the actions taken in steps 1â€“5 above need amendment.
 3. Resume this document from step 7 above.
